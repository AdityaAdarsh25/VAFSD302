        <p>Unfortunate" doesn't begin to describe my series, this game rewards blind luck and nothing else,
             I am beyond convinced at this point. After getting completely tooled by scheduling with my opponent
            changing times on me last minute and refusing to provide confirmation prior to the day of the match
            as to play times, losing this way somehow felt even worse than I had thought possible
            My preparation was superior, my play was superior, and I lost, so I don't see a reason to continue
            engaging in an activity where what is within my control is overwhelmingly outweighed by what is not
            This community is infected to its roots with a degenerative disease that grows stronger over time
            but stops short of killing its host.</p>
